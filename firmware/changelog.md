## emonTx V3.4 firmware change log:

- V3.4   05/01/21 Slow down DS18B20 conversion - required for new batch of RJ45 temp sensors 
- V3.3   05/12/19 Fix RFM factory test
- V3.2   27/08/19 Add watchdog reset
- V3.1   25/05/18 Prompt to set 'Both CR & NL' on serial monitor.
- V3.0   16/01/18 Return zero reading when CT is disconnected and always sample from all CT's when powered by AC-AC (negate CT's required plugged in before startup)
- v2.9   30/03/17 Correct RMS voltage calc at startup when USA mode is enabled
- v2.8   27/02/17 Correct USA voltage to 120V
- v2.7   34/02/17 Fix USA apparent power readings (assuming 110VRMS when no AC-AC voltage sample adapter is present). Fix DIP switch nodeID config incorrect serial print if node ID has been set via EEPROM serial config and DIP switch.
- v2.6   31/10/16 Add RF config via serial & save to EEPROM feature. Allows RF settings (nodeID, freq, group) via serial
- v2.5   19/09/16 Increase baud 9600 > 115200 to emonesp compatibility
- v2.4   06/09/16 Update serial output to use CSV string pairs to work with emonESP e.g. 'ct1:100,ct2:329'
- v2.3   16/11/15 Change to unsigned long for pulse count and make default node ID 8 to avoid emonHub node decoder conflict & fix counting pulses faster than 110ms, strobed meter LED http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/11490
- v2.2   12/11/15 Remove debug timing serial print code
- v2.1   24/10/15 Improved timing so that packets are sent just under 10s, reducing resulting data gaps in feeds + default status code for no temp sensors of 3000 which reduces corrupt packets improving data reliability
- V2.0   30/09/15 Update number of samples 1480 > 1662 to improve sampling accurancy: 1662 samples take 300 mS, which equates to 15 cycles @ 50 Hz or 18 cycles @ 60 Hz.
- V1.9   25/08/15 Fix spurious pulse readings from RJ45 port when DS18B20 but no pulse counter is connected (enable internal pull-up)
- V1.8 - 18/06/15 Increase max pulse width to 110ms
- V1.7 - 12/06/15 Fix pulse count denounce issue & enable pulse count pulse temperature
- V1.6 - Add support for multiple DS18B20 temperature sensors
- V1.5 - Add interrupt pulse counting - simplify serial print debug
- V1.4.1 - Remove filter settle routine as latest emonLib 19/01/15 does not require
- V1.4 - Support for RFM69CW, DIP switches and battery voltage reading on emonTx V3.4
- V1.3 - fix filter settle time to eliminate large initial reading
- V1.2 - fix bug which caused Vrms to be returned as zero if CT1 was not connected
- V1.1 - fix bug in startup Vrms calculation, startup Vrms startup calculation is now more accurate

`emonhub.conf` node decoder (nodeid is 8 when switch is off, 7 when switch is on)
